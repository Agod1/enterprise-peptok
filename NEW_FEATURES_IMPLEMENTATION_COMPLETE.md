## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Backend Integration (NestJS-First)**

All new features built with NestJS backend-first approach:

```typescript
// Session Recommendation Engine → NestJS
GET / api / v1 / coaches / { coachId } / availability;
POST / api / v1 / sessions / recommendations;
POST / api / v1 / sessions;

// Schedule Updates → NestJS
PUT / api / v1 / sessions / { sessionId };
POST / api / v1 / notifications / reschedule;

// Secure Messaging → NestJS + WebSocket
GET / api / v1 / messaging / conversations;
POST / api / v1 / messaging / messages;
WebSocket: /ws/aeggimnss;

// Analytics → NestJS
GET / api / v1 / analytics / dashboard / landing;
GET / api / v1 / analytics / dashboard / coach / { coachId };
GET / api / v1 / analytics / dashboard / enterprise / { companyId };
```

### **Data Persistence Strategy**

- ✅ **Primary**: All data persisted to PostgreSQL via NestJS
- ✅ **Caching**: Redis for real-time features (messaging, availability)
- ✅ **Fallback**: Local mock data for development/demo
- ✅ **Sync**: Real-time updates via WebSocket + HTTP polling backup

### **Security Implementation**

- ✅ **End-to-end encryption** for messaging
