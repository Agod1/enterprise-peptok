### 3. **Removed Sarah Johnson from TechCorp Account** üë§

**Files Updated:**

### 4. **Enhanced Data Cleanup Systems** üßπ

**New Files Created:**

- `src/utils/techCorpAccountCleanup.ts` - Specific cleanup utility for TechCorp account
- Enhanced `src/utils/clearDummyData.ts` - Added Sarah Johnson and mock program cleanup

**Cleanup Features:**

- **Automatic Cleanup**: Runs on app startup to remove any remaining mock data
- **TechCorp Specific**: Dedicated cleanup for admin@techcorp.com account
- **Sarah Johnson Programs**: Specifically removes any programs associated with Sarah Johnson
- **Mock Titles**: Removes programs with "React Development Training" or "Leadership Development Program Q1 2024"

### 5. **Ensured Real Program Details Display** ‚ú®

**Implementation:**

- **Dynamic Data**: All program displays now use real program data from `programService`
- **Fallback Handling**: When real data isn't available, uses generic placeholders instead of mock data
- **Coach Information**: Coach details pulled from actual program assignments
- **Session Details**: Session information based on real program timeline and data

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Cleanup System Architecture

```typescript
// App Startup (main.tsx)
dummyDataCleaner.initializeCleanSystem();
techCorpCleanup.performCompleteCleanup();

// Removes:
// - Sarah Johnson programs
// - React Development Training references
// - Leadership Development Program Q1 2024 references
// - Mock coach assignments
// - Hardcoded session data
```

### Data Flow

1. **Program Creation**: Uses real timeline and participant data
2. **Coach Assignment**: Based on actual coach selection, not hardcoded
3. **Session Display**: Shows real session information from program data
4. **Account Management**: TechCorp account shows only legitimate programs

### Key Safeguards

- **Real Data Priority**: Always prefers real program data over placeholders
- **Generic Fallbacks**: Uses professional but non-specific fallbacks when needed
- **Dynamic Loading**: Coach and program information loaded from actual selections
- **Account Integrity**: admin@techcorp.com correctly associated with David Johnson

## üéØ Results

- ‚ùå "React Development Training" hardcoded in multiple components
- ‚ùå "Leadership Development Program Q1 2024" in demo data

## üöÄ Final State

3. **Professional Fallbacks**: Generic placeholders when real data unavailable
4. **Account Integrity**: TechCorp account properly configured
5. **Automatic Maintenance**: Cleanup systems prevent future mock data accumulation

All mock coaching program references have been successfully removed and replaced with dynamic, real program details.
